# Stephen Sequenzia: Machine Learning Engineer
I'm a skilled staff-level **Machine Learning Engineer** with a strong foundation in **Software Engineering**, **Data Engineering**, and **MLOps**. With hands-on experience building end-to-end machine learning pipelines, I specialize in designing scalable data architectures, deploying robust ML models, and automating workflows using MLOps best practices. Passionate about creating impactful AI solutions, I leverage my expertise in Python, cloud services, and DevOps tools to bridge the gap between data science experimentation and production deployment. My goal is to deliver reliable and efficient machine learning systems that drive business value.
